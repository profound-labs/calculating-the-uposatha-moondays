Unresolved questions:

- Checkme: The formulas predict 2016 to have an adhikavāra
- Where in the year is the adhikavāra inserted?
- Only Mahānikāya adds adhikavāra?
- Where is the Pāli method for inserting the adhikamāsa used?
- Thai text in [references folder](https://github.com/profound-labs/calculating-the-uposatha-moondays/tree/master/references): Calendar and Era use in Thailand from /The Journal of the Royal Institute of Thailand/ -- does it have relevant notes?
